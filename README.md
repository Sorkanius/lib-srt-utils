# lib-srt-utils

A Python library containing supporting code for running [SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt) tests.

## Installation

Install with `pip` (a virtualenv is recommended), using pip's VCS requirement specifier. Remember to quote the full URL to avoid shell expansion:

`pip install 'git+https://github.com/mbakholdina/lib-srt-utils.git@v0.1#egg=srt_utils'`

This installs the version corresponding to the git tag 'v0.1'. You can replace that with a branch name, a commit hash, or a git ref as necessary. See the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support) for details.
